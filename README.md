Automatidata - Fictive Machine Learning Case Study

        "This project is a fictive business case based on a fictive data consulting firm called Automatidata.\n",
        "\n",
        "To set the stage: they recently hired me as the newest member of their data analytics team. Congratulations for me!\n",
        "\n",
        "Their newest client, the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), wants the Automatidata team to build a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares using existing data that was collected over the course of a year. The team is getting closer to completing the project, having completed an initial plan of action, initial Python coding work, EDA, and A/B testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Automatidata team has reviewed the results of the A/B testing. Now it’s time to work on predicting the taxi fare amounts. You’ve impressed your Automatidata colleagues with your hard work and attention to detail. The data team believes that you are ready to build the regression model and update the client New York City TLC about your progress.\n",
