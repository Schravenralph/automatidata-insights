Automatidata - Fictive Machine Learning Case Study

Please head over to my iPython Notebook on this case study. I will set the stage for you, explain the steps we'll take in the process, and show you the results.

If you would prefer to just execute the code without the fluff - I also compiled the notebook into a nifty script for you, which is listed as "Automatidata.py".

See you there!
